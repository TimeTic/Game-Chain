# Game-Chain

This was the 7th module I worked on with two of my friends. We used React to create a website that is selling games. That was our first time building a large website using React, JS, CSS. We worked on it for 2 months, and presneted it at DAE on the last day of graduation, to showcase what we have learned so far.
